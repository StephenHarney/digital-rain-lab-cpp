## Introduction

This is my digital Rain project for c++ module, it has an effect that can have rainging charactors on the screen,
Just like the Matrix Movie!!.With the power of C++ this can be achieved within VisualStudio and can print the Digtial Rain effect just like the movie. With the power of vectors filling Matrixes this can be achived and using the FillRand fucntion from the random number library we can fill the rainingCharactors array with random charactors to make it seem like the charactors are random.



Design & Test
To design the DigitalRain I used C++ programming langauge and use visaul studio IDE.
I used vectors to fill a 2d matrix that will fill the matrix with randomcharactors to print the matrix before it could print the random charactors which is achived by using the random number library.
