## This is My Digital Rain Project C++

This is my digital Rain project for c++ module, it has an effect that can have rainging charactors on the screen,
Just like the Matrix Movie!!!

I am using c++ to demostrate the raining charactors effects jsut like the matrix movie intro.
I am using vectors and a algorithm to generate charactors and to fill a matrix to produce the raining charactors effect.

Font can be *Italic* or **Bold**.

Code can be highlighted with `backticks`.

Hyperlinks look like this: [GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/).
